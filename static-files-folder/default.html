            A problem We're all too Familiar With!

        <div  id="CollegeStory1">“There was a time in the spring when it got very hot and my roommates had just gotten a couple of hermit crabs.
             They insisted on keeping the room at 80 degrees because if it was any colder, it would ‘hurt the hermies’ (their words, not mine).
             I couldn’t tell the R.A. because I didn’t want to rat on them, so I had to suffer through the heat.” <br> &#8212

        <div  id="CollegeStory2">“My freshman year, my roommate used to tweet about me all semester long. She never left the room and legitimately tweeted over 50 times about me and my friend, and whatever we were talking about. 
            She even posted a 17-minute voice memo of us once. It became a thing for my friend and I to check her tweets every morning to see if she wrote about us.
             She never knew that we found out. #ChroniclesOfTheDrunkVariety if you’re interested.” <br>&#8212 <a href="https://www.seventeen.com/life/real-girl-stories/a22132646/worst-roommate-horror-stories/">Stephanie, 21</a></div>
